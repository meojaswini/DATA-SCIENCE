On first week we have performed exploratory data analysis to see all kinds of relationships.
At first, we have designed a wordcloud which show item names with varying font size and item with maximum font size and intensity have been bought for maximum times.
Second we have plotted several plots to see relationship between purchase frequecy and price and next to see relationship between product and average ordered quantity.
Purchase frequency can be calculated as No. of times that item was bought divided by 373(Total no. of days for which the online retail dataset has been recorded).
Average ordered quantity can be calculated as quantity divided by no. of times that item was bought.

## The output folder contains all the graphs and wordcloud image separately.
